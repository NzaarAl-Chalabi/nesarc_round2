#this is a pipeline developed by Nzaar Al-Chalabi for the imputation and quality control of genetic data for polygenic risk score.
#we will be using tools such as plink, bcftools and prsice2 to complete all the neccessary steps.
#also, some of these steps are extremely computationally demanding depending on the sample size. If you are working with hundreds and thousands of genetic samples then I would say this is near impossible without knowing how to submit jobs to the cluster. 
      #therefore before I begin on the tutorial regarding the manipulation of genetic files i would first show you how to submit a job to the cluster.
      
      
#Section 1: How to Submit a Job to the Cluster 
#ok so what is a job? whenever you log into the cluster your first 2 lines of code look something like this

ssh dev01 
cd /external/mgmt3/genome/scratch/Deluca/nalchalabi/TutorialPGRS/

#you have accessed a development node and changed your directory to the necessary location to do your work.
#however when you code on the development node you arent actually using the full computing power of the cluster. The cluster is a "super computer" in a sense in that its a bunch of computers connected togehter to perform computationally demanding tasks. 
#the development nodes "ssh dev01 and ssh dev02" are just small parts of the cluster that are designed for you to put together a job submission to the cluster....

#section 4: PRSice2 for PRS Generation

#i am also going to assume you have been sent the necessary genetic files in vcf or plink binary format (bed/bim/fam)




#1. step one is obtaining all the necessary files in the correct directories. Using the cluster please upload your necessary files for analysis in either VCF or bed/bim/fam format. 
  #if you have a unique file format such as PED or GEN file, you can convert pretty easily using plink
      # a sample code would be something like this:
      
plink --file input_file --make-bed --out output_prefix

plink --vcf input_file.vcf --make-bed --out output_prefix


      # the first line would convert ped file to a bed/bim/fam file format.
       #the second line would convert a vcf file to a bed/bim/fam file format.
